### There are 2 folders here:
The blue-colar-web-app is a clone of the base app.
The travel-advisor-chakraui-nextjs-feb22 contains logic for pulling maps, and adding in the API endpoint for workers so that they are spread over the map.

### To load the maps:
cd into travel-advisor-chakraui-nextjs-feb22 repo i.e cd travel-advisor-chakraui-nextjs-
npm i ( to install the dependencies)
npm run dev (Notice, it will throw an error.)

### This is because the maps API key and travel-advisory API key are not valid.
To get the Maps API key, check this video -
To get the travel-advisory API keu, check this video - 

### Run afresh
Now hit npm run dev 
You should see maps displayed and a side bar containing hotels according to maps marker.
we will change the hotels to workers after Ken's done.
